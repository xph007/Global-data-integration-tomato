# Degradation of pathogen-stimulating root exudates by a SynCom protects plant health
Root exudates serve as a critical bridge between plants and their associated microbial communities. Certain root exudates, often referred to as “harmful” exudates, can substantially promote the growth and virulence of soilborne pathogens, and their accumulation is regarded as a major contributor to soil degradation and disease outbreaks. In contrast, microbial communities in healthy soils possess the capacity to efficiently metabolize these “harmful” exudates, thereby playing a crucial role in maintaining soil health and supporting stable crop production. In this study, we integrated large-scale microbiome datasets from healthy soils and applied metagenomics and untargeted metabolomics to systematically identify widely distributed functional microbial taxa. From these, we identified a manipulable core microbial community, primarily composed of Sphingomonas, Microbacterium, Streptomyces, and Aeromicrobium. Based on this, we developed a targeted synthetic community (SynCom) and successfully applied it to control bacterial wilt in solanaceous crops, reducing disease incidence to approximately 20%. Moreover, field trials conducted in naturally infested soils achieved a 28% reduction in tomato bacterial wilt incidence. Mechanistic analysis revealed that the SynCom effectively degraded key tomato root exudates that promote R. solanacearum pathogenicity, including 3-hydroxybutyric acid, glutamate, succinate, and related compounds. In summary, we employed machine learning to efficiently identify beneficial microbial community from healthy soils that can degrade virulence-promoting exudates, providing both a theoretical framework and a practical approach for the biocontrol of bacterial wilt across multiple crop systems.
