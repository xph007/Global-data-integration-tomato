Erasing rhizosphere metabolites of pathogenic stimulation by SynCom to protect plant healthy
Rhizosphere metabolites act as a key bridge to connect plant and associated microbes. Most metabolites are involved in beneficial interactions for host plant, while a small proportion was 'utilized' by pathogens. Efficiently removing “bad metabolites” would maintain plant healthy. Microbial strategy, especially synthetic microbial community (SynCom), is the promising and sustainable approaches to minimize disease impacts. By analyzing 56 bacterial datasets from rhizosphere samples of healthy and bacterial wilt-diseased plants using machine learning, 23 biomarker genera were identified with a classification model score of 93 . Subsequent sequence alignment of isolated strains and metagenomic data selected six biomarkers enriched in healthy samples for SynCom construct. A pot experiment showed SynCom reduced tomato disease by 39%, and a simplified SynCom with four strains (Sphingomonas sp., Microbacterium sp., Streptomyces sp., Aeromicrobium sp.) reduced disease by 41%, 28%, and 30% in tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants, respectively. Field trials on natural diseased soils achieved a 28% reduction in tomato disease. Metabolic profiling revealed simplified SynCom suppressed disease by synergetic “erasing” tomato exudates that enhance R. solanacearum pathogenicity and shifted the rhizosphere microbiome from “diseased” to “healthy” state.  Overall, this study provides a targeted approach for creating SynCom to combat soil-borne diseases and support sustainable agriculture.
